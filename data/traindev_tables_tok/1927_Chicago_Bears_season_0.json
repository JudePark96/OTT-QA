  "intro": "The 1927 season was the Chicago Bears' 8th in the National Football League. The team was unable to improve on their 12-1-3 record from 1926 and finished with a 9-3-2 record under head coach George Halas earning them a third-place finish in the team standings behind the New York Giants and the Green Bay Packers. Notable games during this season were a split of the season series with the New York Yankees, led by former and future Bear Red Grange, a split of the season's games against crosstown rivals Chicago Cardinals, two wins over the Green Bay Packers, and, oddest of all, a win and a tie over the Frankford Yellowjackets. What makes the games with Frankford so notable is they were played back to back on December 3 and 4, with the first game in Frankford and the second in Chicago. The Bears also played the eventual champion New York Giants, losing 13-7. Paddy Driscoll, William Senn, and Joey Sternaman again starred for the Bears. Driscoll ran for 5 touchdowns and threw 4 others; Senn had 3 rushing TDs and 2 receiving scores; and Sternaman ran for and caught 1 touchdown each, while passing for another. Owner and coach George Halas continued to play well, scoring 3 touchdowns himself, 2 on defense."
