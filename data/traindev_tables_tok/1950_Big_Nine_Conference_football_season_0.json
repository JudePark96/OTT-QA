  "intro": "The 1950 Big Nine Conference football season was the 55th season of college football played by the member schools of the Big Nine Conference (also known as the Western Conference and the Big Ten Conference) and was a part of the 1950 college football season. The 1950 Michigan Wolverines football team, under head coach Bennie Oosterbaan, won the 1950 Big Ten championship with a 6-3-1 record (4-1-1 against Big Ten opponents) and was ranked No. 9 in the final AP Poll. In the last game of the regular season, Michigan defeated Ohio State, 9-3, in the Snow Bowl, played in a blizzard, at 10 degrees above zero, on an icy field, and with winds gusting over 30 miles per hour. Michigan then defeated California in the 1951 Rose Bowl. Don Dufek was selected as the team's most valuable player. Tackle Allen Wahl was a first-team All-American. The 1950 Ohio State Buckeyes football team, under head coach Wes Fesler, compiled a 6-3 record, led the conference in scoring offense (31.8 points per game), and was ranked No. 14 in the final AP Poll. Halfback Vic Janowicz was a consensus first-team All-American and won both the Chicago Tribune Silver Football trophy as the Big Ten's most valuable player and the Heisman Trophy as the best player in college football. The 1950 Illinois Fighting Illini football team, under head coach Ray Eliot, compiled a 7-2 record, led the conference in scoring defense (6.2 points allowed per game), and was ranked No. 13 in the final AP Poll."
