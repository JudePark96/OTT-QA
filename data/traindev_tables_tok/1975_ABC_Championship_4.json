  "intro": "The 1975 Asian Basketball Confederation Championship for Men were held in Bangkok, Thailand. This was the first time that the Chinese national team participated in the tournament, as Taiwan previously competed instead of the Chinese mainland. However, China dominated the competition with a perfect record, with no team even coming close to beating them."
