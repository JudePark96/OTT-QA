  "intro": "The 39th Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a (Tour of Spain), a long-distance bicycle stage race and one of the 3 Grand Tours, was held from 17 April to 6 May 1984. It consisted of 19 stages covering a total of 3,593 km, and was won by \u00c9ric Caritoux of the Skil-Sem cycling team. Caritoux, a second year professional, had shown his climbing talent earlier that year by winning the stage up the Mont-Ventoux of the 1984 Paris-Nice but he did not enter the 1984 Vuelta a Espana thinking of the overall classification. On the 12th stage to Lagos de Covadonga an area in Asturias which includes one of the most important climbs of the Vuelta, Caritoux finished second behind the German Raimund Dietzen who was also riding his first Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. Caritoux took the leaders jersey from Pedro Delgado. Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez was 32 seconds behind Caritoux in the general classification at that stage. Fern\u00e1ndez had been third the year previously in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and in the Giro d'Italia. On the stage 14 mountain time trial, Caritoux lost five seconds. Caritoux lost further time in the final individual time trial but still managed to finish the race with a slender lead of six seconds over Fern\u00e1ndez, the smallest margin in the history of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, and also the smallest ever seen in a Grand Tour. Fern\u00e1ndez died later on in 1984."
