  "intro": "The 2003-04 Detroit Red Wings season was the 78th National Hockey League season in Detroit, Michigan. Despite multiple injuries to key players, the Wings found themselves once again winning the Presidents' Trophy for having the best regular season record in the NHL, scoring 109 points. In the post-season, they advanced to the Western Conference Semi-finals, where they were eliminated by the eventual Western Conference champion Calgary Flames in six games. Two Red Wings were named to the roster for the 2004 All-Star Game: defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom and center Pavel Datsyuk. Lidstrom was voted into his eighth appearance at the All-Star game by fans, and Datsyuk was selected to the roster for his first appearance. The Red Wings sold out all 41 home games in 2003-04 as 20,066 fans packed Joe Louis Arena for every regular season and playoff game played in Detroit."
