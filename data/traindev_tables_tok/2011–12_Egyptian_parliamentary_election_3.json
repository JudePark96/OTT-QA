  "intro": "A parliamentary election to the People's Assembly of Egypt was held from 28 November 2011 to 11 January 2012, following the revolution that ousted President Hosni Mubarak, after which the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) dissolved the parliament of Egypt. However the dissolution was ruled unconstitutional and Parliament was reinstated. Originally, the elections had been scheduled to be held in September 2011, but was postponed amid concerns that established parties would gain undue advantage. The elections was proclaimed the first honest national elections of any sort held in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy in 1952. However, there were complaints of irregularities and fraud. The main focus of the new elected parliament was to be the selection of the members of the Constituent Assembly of Egypt."
