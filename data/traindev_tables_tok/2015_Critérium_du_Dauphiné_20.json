  "intro": "The 2015 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 was the 67th edition of the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 cycling stage race. The eight-stage race in France began in Ugine on 7 June and concluded in Modane on 14 June, and was sixteenth of the twenty-eight races in the 2015 UCI World Tour season. The Dauphin\u00e9 was viewed as a preview for July's Tour de France and a number of the contenders for the general classification of the Tour participated in the race. The first leader of the general classification was 's Peter Kennaugh, who won the opening stage. He lost the race lead to rider Rohan Dennis, whose team won stage three's team time trial. His teammate Tejay van Garderen then took over after the race's first mountain stage, stage five. Vincenzo Nibali of the team took the lead after the stage six, before Van Garderen regained it following stage. Chris Froome (), who was second to Van Garderen after the penultimate stage, claimed the race victory with his win on the final stage. Van Garderen finished second overall, ten seconds in arrears, with 's Rui Costa third, a further one minute and six seconds down. In the race's other classifications, Nacer Bouhanni () won the sprinter's points classification. The mountains classification was won by 's Daniel Teklehaimanot, who achieved it by getting in the early breakaways and placing highly over categorised climbs. Simon Yates of won the young rider classification as the best rider born after 1 January 1990."
