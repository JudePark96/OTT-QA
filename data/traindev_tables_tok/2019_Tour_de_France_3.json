A total of 176 riders from 22 teams participated in the race. The overall general classification was won by Egan Bernal of . His teammate and 2018 Tour winner Geraint Thomas finished second while Steven Kruijswijk () came in third. Kruijswijk's teammate Mike Teunissen won stage 1's bunch sprint to take the first yellow of the Tour. Julian Alaphilippe of took the lead of the race following his victory of stage 3. He lost the yellow jersey after the sixth stage to Giulio Ciccone () who was the highest placed rider of a breakaway group which finished ahead of the peloton (main group).
