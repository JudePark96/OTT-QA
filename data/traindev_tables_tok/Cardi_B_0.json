  "intro": "Belcalis Marlenis Alm\u00e1nzar (born October 11, 1992), known professionally as Cardi B, is an Latino rapper, songwriter, television personality and actress. Born in Manhattan and raised in The Bronx, New York City, she became an internet celebrity after several of her posts and videos became viral on Vine and Instagram. From 2015 to 2017, she appeared as a regular cast member on the VH1 reality television series Love & Hip Hop: New York to follow her music aspirations, and released two mixtapes - Gangsta Bitch Music, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, before signing with label Atlantic Records in early 2017. Cardi B has since earned three number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100; Bodak Yellow made her the second female rapper to top the chart with a solo output - following Lauryn Hill in 1998, I Like It made her the only female rapper to attain multiple number-one songs on the chart, and her Maroon 5 collaboration Girls Like You made her the sixth female artist to achieve three number-one singles on the chart during the 2010s. Her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy (2018), on which the former two songs are included, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, broke several streaming records and was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. Critically acclaimed, the album won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, making Cardi B the only woman to win the award as a solo artist. Recognized by Forbes as one of the most influential female rappers of all time, Cardi B is known for her aggressive flow and candid lyrics, which have received widespread media coverage. She is the highest certified female rapper of all time on the RIAA's Top Artists (Digital Singles) ranking, also appearing among the ten highest-certified female artists of all time. Her accolades include a Grammy Award, seven Billboard Music Awards, five Guinness World Records, four American Music Awards and 11 BET Hip Hop Awards. In 2018, Time included her on their annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world."
