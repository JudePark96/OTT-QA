  "intro": "Throughout its history, France's national basketball team has experienced many ups and downs. The time periods where the national team earned medals have been quite streaky. In Europe, team France started out as a fierce competitor. The team won 5 medals at the EuroBasket between 1937 and 1959. 1937: Bronze Medal, 3-2 overall, second in preliminary group, lost semifinal, won bronze medal match\n1947: Silver Medal, 5-1 overall, round robin tournament, no playoffs\n1949: Bronze Medal; 6-3 overall, second in preliminary group at 3-1, won semifinal group in three-way tie-breaker with 2-1 record, lost semifinal, won bronze medal match\n1953: Bronze Medal, 6-4 overall, second in preliminary group at 2-1, second position of four-way tiebreaker for 2nd place in final round with 4-3 record. 1959: Bronze Medal, 7-3 overall, second in preliminary group at 3-1, first in Semi-final round at 3-0, third in final round with 1-2 record. Its period of glory at the world stage began in the late 1940s / early 1950s. At the 1948 Olympics in London, the France team led by Robert Busnel won an Olympic silver medal, the first Olympic medal in its history. The French finished second only to the United States. In the wake of this Olympic medal, France, led by captain Andr\u00e9 Vacheresse, won three consecutive medals, including silver at the EuroBasket 1949, and bronze at the EuroBasket 1951 and the EuroBasket 1953. The following years were less glorious. France's basketball team seemingly declined gradually to disappear almost completely from the two major world competitions during the 1960s and 1970s."
