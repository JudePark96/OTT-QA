  "section_title": "Drivers who have died of a medical condition",
  "section_text": "This list covers both drivers who crashed their cars after suffering a fatal medical condition , i.e . they did not die of the injuries they may have sustained in the ensuing accident , and those who managed to stop their cars but succumbed to a medical condition a little later .",
  "uid": "List_of_NASCAR_fatalities_2",
  "intro": "This article lists drivers who have been fatally injured while competing in or in preparation for (testing, practice, qualifying) races sanctioned by the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR). A separate list compiles drivers who have died of a medical condition while driving or shortly thereafter and another section shows non-driver deaths. The premier series of NASCAR has seen 28 driver fatalities, the most recent of which occurred in February 2001 when Dale Earnhardt was killed during the Daytona 500. Safety in the sport has evolved through the decades. Technological advances in roll cages, window nets, seat mounts, air flaps, driving suits, and helmets as well as the HANS device, on-site medical facilities with helicopters, and SAFER barriers have contributed to the prevention of further deaths."
