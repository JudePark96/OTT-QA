  "intro": "This article contains lists of Palestinian suicide attacks carried out by Palestinian individuals and militant groups. The international community considers the use of indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations as illegal under international law. The first suicide attack was carried out in 1989 and the attacks stopped in 2008. The high point was in 2002 during the Second Intifada. A 2007 study of Palestinian suicide bombings during the Second Intifada (September 2000 through August 2005) found that 39.9 percent of the suicide attacks were carried out by Hamas, 26.4 percent by Fatah, 25.7 percent by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), 5.4 percent by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and 2.7 percent by other organizations. The Simon Wiesenthal Center has advocated classifying suicide bombings, including those committed by Palestinians, as Crimes against humanity, a position adopted by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch in 2002. The criteria used for this list: successful deliberate attacks committed by Palestinian militant groups against civilians and security forces, in which the perpetrators intended to die during the attack."
