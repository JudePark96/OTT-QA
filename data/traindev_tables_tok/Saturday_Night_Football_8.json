  "intro": "ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC (branded for sponsorship purposes as ESPN Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's) is a weekly presentation of prime time broadcasts of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) college football games that are produced by ESPN, and televised on ABC. Games are presented each Saturday evening starting at 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time/6:30 p.m. Central Time during the college football regular season, which has been the case since 2017 (some weeks until 2015 saw no game on ABC, due to Saturday evening Sprint Cup Series NASCAR coverage; ESPN would then carry that week's high-profile game instead, with ESPN2 carrying a secondary game usually seen on ESPN/ABC). The ESPN on ABC Saturday Night Football coverage began in 2006, as both ESPN and ABC are owned by The Walt Disney Company. It is ESPN's biggest game of the week, and in most cases (outside where another networks carries the game), the city and/or campus of that night's game is where that day's ESPN College GameDay had originated. , the primary broadcast team includes play-by-play announcer Chris Fowler and analyst Kirk Herbstreit, with Maria Taylor as sideline reporter, with Tom Rinaldi joining the crew on some Saturday nights. Kevin Negandhi, Jonathan Vilma, and Mark Sanchez host the studio halftime show, and Cassidy Hubbarth hosts the brief Ford Wrap-Up post-game shows. Other ESPN broadcast teams may also occasionally appear for regional (and some national) telecasts."
