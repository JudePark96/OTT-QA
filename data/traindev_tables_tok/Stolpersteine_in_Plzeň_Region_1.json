His classmates quite liked him and saw him as a shy , physically weak , but still persistent boy.\u2033 One day at the beginning of the school year 1939/1940 , the school was visited by Gestapo . Eyewitnesses gave detailed reports how Emil was excluded from school on that day : \u2033Some men standing in the door made Emil pack his things and leave the school forever\u2033 . Thereafter he worked as a labourer . The last residence of the family before deportation was in Pilsen . On 26 January 1942 , Emil Ehrlich and his parents were deported with transport T to Theresienstadt concentration camp . His transport number was 115 of 609 .

Twenty-two days later , on 19 October 1944 , also Josefina L\u00f6bnerov\u00e1 was deported to Auschwitz and murdered immediately after arrival . Also , all three surviving sisters of Emil L\u00f6bner became victims of the Shoah . Mathilda and Erna were killed in October and November 1941 in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto , Levana on 8 October 1942 in Treblinka extermination camp . Both L\u00f6bner sons could survive the Shoah .

Egon L\u00f6bner was deported to Auschwitz too , on the same train like his father , was a forced laborer there , sent on a death march to Gross-Rosen und was transferred to Flossenb\u00fcrg , where he had to work for Messerschmitt .

  "section_title": "Plze\u0148",
  "section_text": "The Old Synagogue of Plze\u0148 The Jewish community of Plze\u0148 was established in the 14th century , as one of the first in Bohemia . The first record of the community is a decree of Charles IV from 1338 , in which the administrators of the town were ordered to protect the Jews . The community built a synagogue , and , in 1432 , bought land for a cemetery . For a long period , there was peaceful cooperation and trade between Jews and Christians \u2014 until 1504 , when charges of desecration of hosts led to the expulsion of all Jews from Plze\u0148 . Nevertheless , some Jews managed to settle in the town in the early 19th century illegally . In 1821 a total of 32 resided in Plze\u0148 without permit . This changed drastically in 1848 , when the Austrian monarch lifted residence restrictions for Jews in the whole empire . Now , Jews came back to attend the Plze\u0148 markets and to officially take residence in the town . By 1854 , the Jewish population of the town had jumped to 249 . In 1856 , a Jewish cemetery was consecrated . In 1859 , a synagogue was inaugurated . In spite of anti-Jewish riots of 1866 , the Jewish population continued to grow \u2014 and reached the number 1,207 in 1870 . At the beginning of the 20th century the Jewish community of Plze\u0148 was among the largest and most affluent in Bohemia . It could afford to construct a large synagogue in the Moorish style , built in 1893 , called the Great Synagogue . The first lodge of Bnai Brith in Bohemia was founded in town . [ 67 ] Since 1918 , the community employed two rabbis , one for Czech services , the other one for German language services . The community was quite diverse then , ideologically the Jews of Plze\u0148 were split into three groups , the Czech nationalist Jews , the German assimilationists and the Zionists . In 1920 , a severe and years-long controversy on kosher slaughtering broke out , when it was declared illegal for humanitarian reasons . Although the Supreme Court abolished this kind of prohibition in 1934 , attempts to reintroduce Shechita failed , due to the price difference . In 1921 , the Jews of Plze\u0148 numbered 3,117 . But thereafter the Jews population declined to 2,773 in 1930 ( 2.4% of the total population ) . After the annexation of Sudetenland by Hitler 's Reich in the fall of 1938 , many Jews from these regions arrived in the city . [ 67 ] They felt in safety , but this changed drastically when Hitler Germany invaded the rest of Bohemia and Moravia in March 1939 . The so-called Nuremberg Laws were also put in effect in the so-called Protectorate , Jews in Plze\u0148 were gradually deprived of their civil rights and liberties , their social status , their property and employment . They were treated like inferiors and exposed to degrading repressions on administrative , psychological and physical levels . [ 68 ] One of the last letters of Robert Auer ( born in Plze\u0148 ) and his wife Ernestine , both murdered by the Nazi regime In January 1942 , at least two thousand of Plze\u00f2 citizens of all professions , all social classes and all ages ( workers , craftsmen , tradesmen , bankers , lawyers , teachers , physicians , officials , housewives , children and elderly persons ) were interned in the Sokol building in \u0160truncovy Sady and deported from town after several days . They were labelled `` Jews '' by the Nazis on the basis of their genealogical origin \u2014 not considering their faith nor their national or denominational feeling . They were forced to wear the yellow badge on the left side of the coats . Also interned and then deported were 540 Jews from nearby areas \u2013 men , women and children from Blovice , Ho\u0159ovice , Kralovice , Man\u011bt\u00edn , Radnice , Rokycany and Zbiroh . The three deportation trains left Plze\u00f2 railway station within ten days , their destination was Theresienstadt concentration camp : 17 January : transport T with 1,000 deportees ( murdered : 927 , survived : 73 ) . [ 69 ] 22 January : transport S with 1,004 deportees ( murdered : 937 , survived : 67 ) . [ 69 ] 26 January : transport T with 609 deportees ( murdered : 543 , survived : 66 ) . [ 70 ] The Pilsen deportation trains with 2,613 persons were among the first to arrive in Theresienstadt . The youngest was Eva Fischerov\u00e1 , eight months old , the oldest was Marie Ebenov\u00e1 from Rokycany , nearly 90 . [ 71 ] [ 71 ] Most of the deportees had to walk from the Bohu\u0161ovice railway station about two and a half kilometers to the camp , carrying children and luggage in the severe cold . There , families were separated , the living conditions in the barracks were gruesome , the food scarce . By the end of 22 January people of old age perished , among them Marie Ebenov\u00e1 . Already in March of the same year two transports , Aa and Ab , each containing 1,000 people , were sent from Thersienstadt to the Izbica Ghetto . 620 of them were men , women and children from the Pilsen region . Additional 700 persons from the region were deported to ghettos , concentration camps and extermination camps in eastern Poland , Belorussia , Estonia and Latvia . On 26 October 1942 the first transport to Auschwitz left the camp . By the end of the year , not even one-third of the deportees was alive . More than 1,800 men , women and children had been murdered within the first eleven months after deportation . Only 206 of the Pilsen deportees could survive the Shoah . Today , a little more than 70 Jews live in Plze\u0148 .",

  "intro": "The Stolpersteine in the Plze\u0148sk\u00fd kraj lists the Stolpersteine in the Plze\u0148 Region () in the western part of Bohemia. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist Gunter Demnig. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide. Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self-chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: Kameny zmizel\u00fdch, stones of the disappeareds."
