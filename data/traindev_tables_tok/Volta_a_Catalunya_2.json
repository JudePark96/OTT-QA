  "intro": "The Volta a Catalunya (Catalan pronunciation: [\u02c8b\u0254lt\u0259 \u0259 k\u0259t\u0259\u02c8lu\u0272\u0259]; English: Tour of Catalonia, Spanish: Vuelta a Catalu\u00f1a) is a road bicycle race held annually in Catalonia, Spain. It is one of three World Tour stage races in Spain, together with the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and the Tour of the Basque Country. The race has had several different calendar dates, running before in September, June and May. Since 2010 it has been on the calendar in late March as part of the UCI World Tour. Raced over seven days, it covers the autonomous community of Catalonia in Northeast Spain and contains one or more stages in the mountain region of the Pyrenees. The race traditionally finishes with a stage in Barcelona, Catalonia's capital, on a circuit with the famous Montju\u00efc climb and park. First held in 1911, the Volta a Catalunya is the fourth-oldest still-existing cycling stage race in the world. Only the Tour de France (1903), the Tour of Belgium (1908) and the Giro d'Italia (1909) are older. It was the second cycling event organized on the Iberian peninsula, only after the amateur and sub-23 race Volta a Tarragona (1908), equally held in Catalonia but no longer on the calendar. Catalan cycling icon Mariano Ca\u00f1ardo won the race seven times in the 1920s and 1930s, setting an unsurpassed record."
