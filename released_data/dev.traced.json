        "As an undergraduate , Wren joined the circle of mathematicians and natural scientists at Wadham under the leadership of the Warden , John Wilkins . He developed an interest for telescopes and astronomy , building with Wilkins an 80-foot ( 24 m ) long instrument to observe the Moon in 1655 . Oliver Cromwell appointed Wren in 1657 as Professor of Geometry at Gresham College , London , on the recommendation of Wilkins ; Wren lectured on Saturn ( the appearance and phases of which he had earlier studied ) , Kepler 's works , light , and lenses . He provided partial solutions in 1658 to problems relating to curves set by Blaise Pascal , the answers to which would help calculations for planetary orbits . He resigned from Gresham College upon his appointment to the Savilian chair , lecturing on topics such as spheres and navigation . He developed an interest in architecture from his mathematical studies , with early work including the chapel of Pembroke College , Cambridge , and the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford . His architectural skills led to his role in rebuilding London after the Great Fire of 1666 ( including St Paul 's Cathedral ) and his appointment as Surveyor of the King 's Works in 1669 . Isaac Newton described him as one of the foremost geometers of this age . Wren appointed Edward Bernard as his deputy in the chair in 1669 , on his appointment as Surveyor of the King 's Works , and Bernard succeeded him four years later",

        "When still an undergraduate , Ward impressed John Bainbridge ( the first astronomy professor ) during a mathematical disputation . Ward was appointed as university lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge in 1643 , but was deprived of his fellowship in the following year for refusing to agree to the religious oaths required by the Parliamentary authorities . He spent the following years tutoring and improving his mathematical knowledge , before succeeding his friend John Greaves in the Savilian chair , with Greaves 's assistance . University lectures in astronomy were resumed under Ward , who was the first Savilian professor to teach the Copernican discovery that the Earth and other planets revolved around the Sun . He studied comets and the movements of the planets , observing them from the room at the top of the tower of Wadham College in which he lived ; he also preached and published theological works . He was elected Principal of Jesus College , Oxford , in 1657 , but Oliver Cromwell installed Francis Howell instead , raising Ward 's stipend as compensation . He was President of Trinity College , Oxford , from 1659 but resigned 1660 at The Restoration in favour of his ejected predecessor ; he also gave up the professorship in the same year . He later became Bishop of Exeter and then Bishop of Salisbury , where he did much to restore the cathedrals , but did not continue his astronomical studies",

He was married to Josefina L\u00f6bnerov\u00e1 n\u00e9e K\u00f6serov\u00e1 ( born on 23 November 1897 ) . The couple had two sons : Egon ( born on 24 February 1924 ) and Vil\u00e9m Benjamin ( born on 13 March 1926 ) . He became a successful businessman and headed the trade company R. E. Erben . In the late 1920s he could afford to construct a spacious villa in Schwarzova 50 . His wife was a housewife , the sons had Czech and German-speaking nannies and grew up fluent in both languages . Before the Nazis destroyed Czechoslovakia , L\u00f6bner delivered his goods to more than two hundred gas stations in western Bohemia . He was a member and sponsor of the local Jewish community and Zionist organizations . In 1939 , their son Vil\u00e9m emigrated to Palestine . The Nazis confiscated the villa and his company . The family had to move to an apartment in Koll\u00e1rovy 18 . On 18 January 1942 he , his wife and their son Egon were arrested and deported from Pilsen to Theresienstadt concentration camp by transport R. His transport number was 406 of 1,000 . On 7 July 1942 also his parents arrived at Theresienstadt . Unfortunately they both perished within the same year due to the harsh conditions there and due to starvation . Regina L\u00f6bnerov\u00e1 died on 23 August 1942 , Sigmund L\u00f6bner on 30 December 1942 . After twenty months in Theresienstadt , the family were separated . While his wife had to remain in the Ghetto there , Emil and Egon L\u00f6bner were deported on 28 September 1944 to Auschwitz concentration camp by transport Ek . His transport number was 364 of 2,500 . Emil L\u00f6bner lost his life there , when exactly is unknown , probably on the day of his arrival . Twenty-two days later , on 19 October 1944 , also Josefina L\u00f6bnerov\u00e1 was deported to Auschwitz and murdered immediately after arrival . Also , all three surviving sisters of Emil L\u00f6bner became victims of the Shoah . Mathilda and Erna were killed in October and November 1941 in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto , Levana on 8 October 1942 in Treblinka extermination camp . Both L\u00f6bner sons could survive the Shoah . A photograph shows them both in the 1960s in Israel . Vil\u00e9m L\u00f6bner emigrated to Palastine in 1939 . Egon L\u00f6bner was deported to Auschwitz too , on the same train like his father , was a forced laborer there , sent on a death march to Gross-Rosen und was transferred to Flossenb\u00fcrg , where he had to work for Messerschmitt . In May 1945 , he was liberated by General Patton 's Third Army . He went back to Pilsen , completed high school and emigrated to the United States , became a renowned scientist in the field of optoelectronics , married and had three children . He testified in Auschwitz trials in Germany and was an important testimony of the Shoah . He died on 30 December 1989 in Palo Alto , California . Also Emil L\u00f6bner 's brother Walter could survive Auschwitz . He emigrated as well and died on 18 August 1989 in Haifa , Israel",

He was involved with an international project to conduct a photographic survey and catalogue of stars , and devised a method of calculating a star 's true position , making the work much easier . This was recognised by the award of the Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific ( 1927 ) . After his appointment to the Oxford professorship , his attempts to have a house built for him at the university 's observatory were unsuccessful , as the dispute between the university and the Radcliffe Observatory that had begun with George Johnson 's appointment in 1839 continued . He supported the decision of the Radcliffe trustees to move their observatory to a better site , in South Africa , in 1929 , but was attacked by fellow Oxford academics in the struggles for improving science facilities at the university thereafter . He was heavily involved in the work of the Royal Astronomical Society and international astronomical groups , and developed interests in geophysics and seismology , where he was one of the first to suggest that the earth 's core was liquid",
